          The new Ultra Wide camera with autofocus takes incredibly sharp, detailed macro photos and videos. 
          You can also frame more expansive scenes without taking a step back. And because it has a larger 
          aperture and bigger pixels, it can capture up to 2.6x more light for higher image quality â€” even in low light.
